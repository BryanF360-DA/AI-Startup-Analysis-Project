# Retail Sales Data Pipeline & Analysis with Python, SQL, and Power BI

#### **Project Goal**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, from handling raw, real-world data to building an interactive business dashboard. The primary objective is to showcase proficiency in data cleaning, database management, and advanced SQL querying to provide actionable business intelligence.

#### **Data Source**
The core of this project is a real-world, public-domain dataset: `Cannabis_Retail_Sales_by_Week_Ending.csv`. This dataset, sourced from data.gov, provides weekly sales figures for adult-use and medical marijuana. The raw nature of this data required significant cleaning and preparation, which is a key focus of this project.

#### **Tools Used**
* **Python:** Utilized for data cleaning and preparation, including handling date format conversions and ensuring data integrity.
* **SQL (SQLite):** Used to build a relational database, providing a structured environment for data storage and complex querying. This demonstrates foundational knowledge of data modeling.
* **Power BI:** The final visualization tool used to create an interactive dashboard, translating data insights into a clear and compelling story for stakeholders.

#### **Key Analysis & Business Questions**
This project addresses several key business questions:
* What are the weekly and monthly retail sales trends for both adult-use and medical marijuana?
* What is the total sales revenue and total number of products sold over the entire period?
* How has the average product price changed over time for each market segment?
* What is the revenue share between adult-use and medical sales, and has this proportion shifted?

#### **Project Structure**
The repository is organized to follow a logical data pipeline:
* `data/`: Contains the raw `Cannabis_Retail_Sales_by_Week_Ending.csv` file.
* `notebooks/`: Includes the Python and SQL scripts used for data cleaning, loading, and analysis.
* `visualizations/`: Will contain the final Power BI dashboard file (`.pbix`).
* `README.md`: This overview of the project.

#### **Key Findings (Work in Progress)**
