# E-commerce Sales Analysis with SQL & Power BI

## Project Objective
This is an advanced portfolio project designed to demonstrate a clear progression of data analysis skills. The objective is to analyze a real-world e-commerce dataset by building a relational data model, combining multiple data sources with complex SQL `JOIN` queries, and creating an executive sales dashboard in Power BI.

## Data Sourcing
The data for this project is the "Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist," available on Kaggle. It contains multiple, related files that mimic a real-world business database structure. You can find the raw data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

## Tools Used
* **Data Preparation:** Microsoft Excel
* **Database:** SQLite
* **Data Analysis & Transformation:** SQL (specifically `JOIN`s)
* **Data Visualization:** Power BI

## Project Workflow (In Progress)

### Module 1: Data Preparation in Excel
The initial phase involves using Excel to perform preliminary data cleaning on one of the source files (`products` data) to ensure data quality before loading it into the database.

### Module 2: Database Construction
A relational database will be built in SQLite, with each of the four core CSV files (`orders`, `customers`, `products`, `order_items`) imported into its own separate table.

### Module 3: Analysis with SQL `JOIN`s
This is the core of the project. I will write a single, comprehensive SQL query to combine the four separate tables using `INNER JOIN`s. This query will create a final, unified "master table" that will serve as the single source of truth for the visualization phase.

### Module 4: Visualization in Power BI
The final `final_analysis` table will be connected to Power BI, where I will build an executive sales dashboard to answer key business questions, such as:
* What are the total sales by product category?
* Which customer cities generate the most revenue?
* What are the monthly sales trends over time?

## Final Dashboard
*(Coming Soon! A link to the published Power BI dashboard will be added here once the project is complete.)*
